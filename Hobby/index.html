<p>It’s hard to find a wellness trend that has enjoyed more sustained buzz than yoga.</br>

<br>The number of people practicing yoga in the United States grew more than 50 percent from 2012 to 2016, according to data. The survey found that people who practice yoga are more likely to be active in other forms of exercise like running or cycling, too, and that one in every three Americans said they were somewhat or very likely to practice yoga in the next 12 months.right up arrow
No single reason is driving people to the millennia-old practice. Experts suspect it has something to do with yoga's combination of physical and mental health benefits. </br>
	
<br>The heightened stress and fast pace of today’s world make yoga more relevant than ever, says Sally Sherwin, a yoga instructor at the Center for Integrative & Lifestyle Medicine at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who is certified by Yoga Alliance, the world's largest nonprofit yoga association that certifies teachers and schools. </br>

<br> “We spend so much time on autopilot, checking off things on our to-do list. Yoga can help people slow down,” says Sherwin. </br>

<br> “When you do yoga, your nervous system calms down and you get out of that fight-or-flight state, Sherwin says. “Just sitting and breathing can be yoga. You’re aware, you’re in the moment, and you can find peace in that moment.”</p>
